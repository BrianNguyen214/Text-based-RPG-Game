A hundred years ago, a terrible monster, the Bahamut, ravaged the once peaceful lands of Puritania. 
Immediately, the people of Puritania, who knew not the arts of warfare, were    forced to take arms to defend their lives and their loved ones.
They put a noble resistance, but the hordes of monsters that emerged from the   presence of the Bahamut were too abundant. 
They were sadly overcome by the monsters' sheer numbers. 
Thus, began the malevolent reign of the Bahamut.

The once proud people of Puritania endured years of torment and loss. 
However, they haven't lost hope. 
They established three separate professions, the warrior, mage, and archer, and from these professions, brave heroes emerged to slay the Bahamut in hopes that  they would take back their lands and restore the way life was before the Bahamutcame. 
The Bahamut was aware of these professions, but regarded them as insignificant  threats. 
Moreover, he relished in taking the lives of heroes courageous enough to        challenge him, so he allowed the professions to survive out of his amusement andarrogance. 

However, three promising and daring heroes rose to at last vanquish the tyrant. Without a doubt, I believe these three champions will bring an end to the       Bahamut. 
However, they are inexperienced and need guidance. Thus, you, the user, are     tasked to guide these heroes and help them find their true potential.  

Before we face the Bahamut, your heroes must grow stronger because the Bahamut  is a nearly unstoppable force, but in due time your heroes will obtain power    that surpasses the Bahamut.
Thus, we must begin training on lesser enemies, such as the Slimes.
They are relatively weak and are perfect targets for your fledging heroes to    gain experience and practice. 

***Entering Stage 1*** 
This is the Battle Stats screen where you can see the basic stats of your heroesand enemies: health, mana, and limit. 
From this, you can see how the battle is progressing.
To win a battle, your heroes must eliminate all of the enemies, but your heroes will lose if all of your heroes' health drop to zero.
Your heroes have special abilities that can deal additional damage to enemies orhave unique properties, but they require mana.
Before you try out an ability, use a basic attack.
Here's a battle menu where you choose an action for your hero.
Now that your heroes have all ended their turn, it's the enemies' turn to       attack.
Since the enemies finished their turns, the heroes get their turn, and this     process repeats until either the heroes defeats all of the enemies or your      heroes are defeated.
Now use what you've learned so far to finish up the Slimes.
This is the Level Up screen where your heroes level up and become stronger afterevery stage completed.
Although you managed to defeat the Slimes, they are relatively weak foes, and   you will face many more dangerous enemies ahead.
However, your work was impressive, and you've taken your first step towards     defeating the Bahamut.
You should take a break and save your progress.
After every battle, you are given a chance to save (recommended) or you may     simply continue on to the next level.
***Entering Stage 2***
Now it's time to introduce you to use your heroes' abilities.
This time you'll be facing a team of Skeletons, so that you may try out your newpowers. 
Moreover, from now on you'll be confronting enemies of different types.
Based on the type of the enemy and the type of the hero's ability, the hero may do more or less damage.
For instance, using a Fire based attack on an Wind type enemy will do twenty    percent more damage.
However, using a Fire based attack on a Water type enemy will do twenty percent less damage.
The type advantage cycle goes as follows: Fire > Wind > Lightning > Earth >     Water > Fire.
Use this information to defeat enemies effectively and swiftly. 
In the Battle Menu, type Abilities to open a screen with that hero's abilities.
From the Abilities screen, you can see the different attributes and types of thehero's abilities.
Besides this, your heroes also possess other abilities that can turn the tide ofbattle, and short descriptions of those abilites are given too. 
As a reminder, using an ability costs mana, so beware of your mana consumption.
As you may have noticed, every time your heroes are damaged by an enemy, that   hero gains some of the damage inflicted as limit.
At a 100 limit, your hero's can unleash a powerful move called a Limit Ability  found in the Ability screen.
However, using a Limit Ability consumes a substantial amount of mana and all of that hero's limit, so make sure you use a Limit Ability wisely.
One other important to add, you must type the name of the Limit Ability without spaces.
For instance, the Warrior's Limit Ability is called Relentless Assault, but you must type RelentlessAssault to activate it.
Now, use your heroes' true potential to decimate foes.
Very impressive work.
At this point, you've learned virtually everything you need to know about the   game.
There's only one more challenge left -- the Bahamut.
Defeating the Bahamut will require you to use every trick you've learned so far,and he shows no mercy.
However, I firmly believe that you are the one to bring peace to Puritania once again.

**Entering Final Stage**
At last, we've made it to the final stage.
The Bahamut is just up ahead, but don't be afraid.
Just remember all of the tips and tricks you've learned as they will aid you in this final confrontation.
Let's go.
The Bahamut has an array of devastating attacks, so Heal and Barrier are        incredibly important in this fight.
The Bahamut's type changes every time it's the Bahamut's turn, so use different abilities accordingly.
Once the Bahamut was slain, the hordes of monsters lost their morale to continueterrorizing the citizens of Puritania.
Futhermore, once people heard news of your heroes' victory against the Bahamut, they were filled with overwhelming exurberance and joy.
The Puritanians drove the remaining monster to where they came, and your heroes were celeberated for several decades.
However, you will always be regarded as the savior who freed the Purtanians fromthe terror the Bahamut and his monsters.
